This is a simple bash script aimed at people who want to use yt-dlp to download audio and video from youtube without the hassle of memorizing and inputing various command arguments.

It's as simple as running the script (make sure the file has executable permissions), and selecting the desired options in the various menus.

 More features planned in the future
